# machine-learning-analaysis
It is a project in my post graduate module  to do an analysis and tried to find insight and do predictive analysis using the descriptive analysis done in the dataset.


Below I have attached the problem description.

The business would like to predict any of the columns of data from July 30, 2021 based on the data for July 1 to July 29, 2023. So this is a predictive analysis activity. 

Scikit-learn is a great resource. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html

The data has already been identified and acquired (see file attached), and your task is to apply the remaining stages of the data lifecycle and give your results as a group in a simple report file or Jupyter Notebook to this dropbox. 

You need not have a high accuracy of your prediction model to get good academic grades, however high accuracy results would be very interesting to me.

To calculate accuracy, compare the true values from July 30 with your predicted values.

Feature descriptions:

symbol: the underlying stock

date: the dataset date

adjusted close: the closing price of the underlying stock after extended trading session

stock price: the closing price of the underlying stock

option symbol: string combining other fields identifying the option

expiration: date that the option expires

strike: the price that the option gives you the right to trade the underlying stock

call/put: whether the option is a Call (right to buy underlying stock) or a Put (right to sell underlying stock)

ask/bid/meanprice: market prices of the option (last offer to sell, last offer to buy, and the average of the two prices)

iv: how fearful the market is of a market crash or severe decline in prices

volume: number of contracts traded today

open interest: number of contracts currently held
